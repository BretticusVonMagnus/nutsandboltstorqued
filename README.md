# Nuts and Bolts 2
Welcome to the development page for the Nuts and Bolts 2 Modpack for Minecraft 1.10.2.
This is an open world sandbox modpack developed purely with continued community feedback.


Pack Goals:
* Offer an unrestrictive play of many of the most popular, as well as some lesser known mods.
* minimize any recipe or design conflicts between mods
* help emphasize a play through that encourages the use of many mods
* bring highly configured options, oregen, server and client settings to make the most of what each mod has to offer
* continue to improve the pack with ongoing community involvement.
* Balanced progression centered around gregtech
* HQM Guided goals and objectives, completely optional
